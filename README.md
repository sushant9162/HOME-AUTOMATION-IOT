# HOME-AUTOMATION-IOT
IOT LPG leakage detector project
IOT and Arduino based LPG leakage detection system can be installed in Homes, Hotels, LPG Cylinder storage areas. The main advantage of this project is that it can determine the leakage and send the data over to a website, where it can be monitored and corrective actions can be taken.
If appropriate measures are taken quickly after it is reported over the IOT, it can help in saving the loss of lives and property.
We can enhance the gas leakage detection system project to detect toxic gases. Further, we can add Smoke and Fire Detectors to detect fire
